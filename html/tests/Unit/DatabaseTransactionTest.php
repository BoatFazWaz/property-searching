        // $user = User::create([...]);
        // $post = Post::create([...]);
        
        // 3. After each test, Laravel would automatically do:
        // $connection->rollBack();
        
        // This rollback ensures all changes made during the test are undone
        // and don't affect other tests, making tests completely isolated.
        
        // Even though this example doesn't actually connect to a database,
        // the real implementation would run each test in a transaction
        // that gets rolled back afterward.
